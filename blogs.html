                Creating this portfolio was one of my first big steps as a web developer. At first, it felt overwhelming — from choosing colors to figuring out how to make things responsive. But with patience, tutorials, and trial-and-error, I made it!

            I started with basic HTML and CSS to build the structure and style. I learned how to use Flexbox to align elements, add custom fonts from Google Fonts, and create buttons with hover effects. One of the biggest things I learned was how colors work together — I picked a warm dusty rose background with a deep green accent, and I love the result.

            Of course, it wasn't perfect at first. I had trouble with aligning horizontal lines, placing the image correctly, and adjusting spacing — but I solved each one by testing different approaches and asking questions.

            This portfolio reflects not just my skills, but also my growth. I'm still learning every day, and I plan to keep adding new features and improvements as I go.

                <p>I'll be sharing more about the skills I'm learning (like JavaScript and React), as well as little challenges and how I solve them.

                Stay tuned for more! </p>
